# Projects for 6.S898 Climate Change seminar

Each student is expected to research, present, and write-up a **final project**.

These projects may be done as individual projects, or by a team of two students.
(Of course, a two-person project should involve about twice as much effort as two
one-person projects).

We are very open to the style and topic for these projects; they may involve any
aspect of climate change, including aspects not otherwise covered in the course.
For example, a project might involve:
* historical research on some aspect of climate change
* field research
* model development or model simulation
* a web-hosted queryable database of successful emission mitigation programs
* a study of policy options relating to one aspect of climate change
* a study of resistance to policy
* a study of messaging and presentation of climate change policy options
* ...

The project deadlines are:
* by ____: identify team and three possible topics
* by ____: submit nominal team and topic
* by ____: submit 1-2 page (or equivalent) project proposal
* by ____: meet with staff at least twice about your project
* by ____: present your project to the class
