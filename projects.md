# Projects for 6.S898 Climate Change seminar

Each student is expected to research, present, and write-up a **final project**.

These projects may be done as individual projects, or by a team of two students.
(Of course, a two-person project should involve about twice as much effort as two
one-person projects).

We are very open to the style and topic for these projects; they may involve any
aspect of climate change, including aspects not otherwise covered in the course.
For example, a project might involve the following general topics:
* historical research on some aspect of climate change
* field research
* model development or model simulation
* a study of policy options relating to one aspect of climate change
* a study of resistance to policy
* a study of messaging and presentation of climate change policy options
* ...

Some concrete examples of potential final projects are listed below:
* a web-hosted queryable database of successful emission mitigation programs
* a sculpture of Earth that showcases regional impacts of climate change (e.g. for display on MIT's campus)
* a simulation investigating the climate impacts of the entire Amazon Rainforest burning down
* a report on the impact of a progressive carbon tax on energy systems, global emissions, and climate
* ...

If you are unsure whether a potential topic would be appropriate, feel free to contact the TA (Henri Drake, hdrake at mit.edu).

* by ____: identify team and 2-3 possible topics
