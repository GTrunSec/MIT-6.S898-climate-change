# Projects for 6.S898 Climate Change seminar

Each student is expected to research, present, and write-up a **final project**. The presentations will be about 15 minutes long and take place during the class sessions on Dec 03, Dec 06, and Dec 10. The final project write-up should be about 15 pages long (other formats possible for non-standard projects – see instructor for permission).

These projects may be done as individual projects, or by a team of two students.
(Of course, a two-person project should involve about twice as much effort as two
one-person projects).

The project deadlines are:
* by 09/27/19: identify team and 2-3 possible topics
* by 10/18/19: submit 1-2 page (or equivalent) project proposal
* by 11/08/19: meet with staff at least twice about your project
* by 12/03/19, 12/06/19, 12/10/19: present your project to the class
* by 12/10/19: (last day of class) final project writeup due

We are very open to the style and topic for these projects; they may involve any
aspect of climate change, including aspects not otherwise covered in the course. The basic requirements are: it should be about climate change and it should be interesting!

We imagine that a project could be:
* a meaningful report, perhaps about a focused question relating to climate science, technological approaches to mitigation, policy options, psychology of responses to proposals, etc.
* a report describing novel (but perhaps preliminary) results which may be later developed into a peer-reviewed publication
* a computer program with writeup
* a blog
* visual art or musical composition
* safe and responsible MIT hack
* video
* etc.
We encourage creative formats for the projects; however, the more creative or atypical the project, the more you should consult with the instructors.

The best projects might prompt action.  You can imagine your audience as ordinary individuals (perhaps imagine your parents or the general public), scientists (your professors), institutions (MIT, other universities), corporations associated with carbon (car manufacturers, airlines, oil companies), corporations associated with renewable energy (solar panels, wind turbines, ...). 

The following are a list of some potential projects (feel free to choose one of these or develop your own):
* For the public
  * Awareness projects – anything that helps people realize
    * there is a real urgent problem
    * concrete actions they can take


For example, a project might involve the following general topics:
* historical research on some aspect of climate change
* field research
* model development or model simulation
* a study of policy options relating to one aspect of climate change
* a study of resistance to policy
* a study of messaging and presentation of climate change policy options
* ...

Some concrete examples of potential final projects are listed below:
* a web-hosted queryable database of successful emission mitigation programs
* a sculpture of Earth that showcases regional impacts of climate change (e.g. for display on MIT's campus)
* a simulation investigating the climate impacts of the entire Amazon Rainforest burning down
* a report on the impact of a progressive carbon tax on energy systems, global emissions, and climate
* ... (more examples coming soon)

For inspiration, we recommend students browse our [list of resources](https://github.com/ron-rivest/MIT-6.S898-climate-change/blob/master/resources.md). If you are unsure whether a potential topic would be appropriate, feel free to contact the TA (Henri Drake, hdrake at mit.edu).
