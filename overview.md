**Catalog description**:

______
6.S898 Climate Change seminar
______
Graduate (Fall) 
Prereq: Permission of instructor 
Units: 3-0-9 
______ 
Provides a broad overview of issues related to climate change, with an emphasis
on those aspects most relevant to computer scientists.  Topics planned include climate science, 
climate models and simulations, decision-making under uncertainty, economics, mitigation 
strategies, adaptation strategies, geoengineering, policy-making, messaging, politics.  Course includes
reading and discussion of recent publications and attending guest lectures.  
Involves project formulation, culminating in a presentation of a research project which might include a paper, a blog, software etc.

**Faculty and Staff**:

* Prof. Alan Edelman (edelman at mit.edu)

* Prof. John Fernández (fernande at mit.edu)

* Prof. Ron Rivest (rivest at mit.edu)

* TA: Henri Drake (hdrake at mit.edu)

* Staff: Debbie Goodwin (dlehto at csail.mit.edu)

**Enrollment**:

Enrollment is limited (to about 16–20). This [google form questionaire](https://forms.gle/N9iSj8a5VWyPhACE8) will be used to select students for the class.  No prior background in climate change is required or expected.

Because of limited enrollment and small class size on Tuesdays, we do not expect to allow students
to register as "listeners"--there just won't be room enough on Tuesdays.  

However, the guest lectures on Fridays (in 6-120) will be open to the general MIT community.  If you would like
to be on the mailing list for these lectures, please send email to Henri Drake <hdrake@mit.edu>.

**Website**

All materials for the course (and more) will be posted on the web site:

**Format**:

The class will meet twice a week, on Tuesday (room 56-167) and on Fridays (room 6-120) from 1:00pm—2:30pm.
The Friday class will feature many guest speakers (see full list in schedule below).
The Tuesday class will be seminar-style (students presenting and discussing papers assigned by following guest speaker).

**Grading**

*Project (50%)*: This mostly reflects the oral and written components due at the end of the semester, but points may also be lost if progress identifying, proposing, and executing a project throughout the semester is inadequate. For more information on the projects, [[click here]](https://github.com/ron-rivest/MIT-6.S898-climate-change/blob/master/projects.md).

*Leading Discussions (30%)*: This refelcts participation in the specific parts of the discussion sessions that you are assigned to lead. Responsibilities include preparing leading questions, comments, or facts based on the assigned reading, and following up with other questions and comments from students. Discussion leaders are expected to have not only completed the reading assignment, but also thought critically about its contents.

*Participation (20%)*: This reflects general participation in the course, including but not limited to contributing to class discussions, asking questions at guest lectures, posting questions or comments to Piazza, and going to TA office hours. Points will be lost if it becomes clear you have not done the readings.

**TA Office Hours and Recitation Schedule**
To be determined...

**Discussion and Announcements**

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and the instructors. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.
