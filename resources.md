# Resources for MIT 6.S898 Climate Change seminar (Fall 2019)

by Alan Edelman, John Fernandez, and Ron Rivest

These are _potential_ readings and links only; 
actual assignments for the class will be a subset of these.

This material may also be useful for those wishing to "self-study".

Also check the "docs" directory for additional material.

(This page needs some restructuring...)
